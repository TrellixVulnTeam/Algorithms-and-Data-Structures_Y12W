# Given an array A[] of N integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet.
# Each packet can have variable number of chocolates.
# There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
# 1. Each student gets one packet.
# 2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students in packet
#     with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
